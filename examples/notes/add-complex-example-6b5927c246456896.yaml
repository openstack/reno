prelude: |
  This paragraph will
  retain its newlines
  when the value is passed to the
  reStructuredText parser, which
  will then merge them into
  a single paragraph without
  breaks.

  | These
  | lines
  | are prefixed
  | with | so the reStructuredText
  | parser will retain
  | the line breaks.
features:
  This note is a simple string, and does not retain its
  formatting when it is rendered in HTML. rst markup here
  may break the YAML parser, since the string is not escaped.
fixes:
  - Use YAML lists to add multiple items to the same section.
  - Another fix could be listed here.
other:
  - |
    This bullet item includes a paragraph and a nested list,
    which works because the content of the YAML list item
    is an escaped string block with reStructuredText formatting.

    * list item 1
    * list item 2

    .. code-block:: text

      This example is also rendered
      correctly on multiple lines
      as a pre-formatted block.
