    Reno now allows specifying subsections, which will appear under
    their top-level sections like "Features". This allows you to group
    related changes together better.

    To enable, set the ``sections`` value in config. Add subsections directly
    underneath their top-level section, with the number ``2`` or ``3`` after
    to indicate its nesting level. For example,
    ``["features_command_line", "Command Line", 2]``. Then, in your release note
    files, use the ID of the subsection, e.g. ``features_command_line``.
