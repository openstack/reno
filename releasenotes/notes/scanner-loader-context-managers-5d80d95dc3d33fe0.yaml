    Instances of ``reno.scanner.Scanner`` and ``reno.loader.Loader`` will now
    corectly close all open files related to the scanned Git repo when the
    ``close()`` method is called. Alternatively, these classes may be used as
    a context manager. Previously, Python would attempt to close these files
    itself, resulting in a ``ResourceWarning`` warning being emitted.

    The ``reno.scanner.Scanner`` and ``reno.loader.Loader`` classes can now
    be used as context managers. For example::

        import reno.scannner

        with reno.scanner.Scanner(...) as scanner:
            pass

    This will ensure any open files pertaining to the scanned Git repo are
    correctly closed, avoiding ``ResourceWarning`` instances otherwise seen.

    A ``close()`` method is also provided for both, allowing use outside of
    context managers. For example::

        import reno.loader

        loader = reno.loader.Loader(...)
        try:
            pass
        finally:
            loader.close()
