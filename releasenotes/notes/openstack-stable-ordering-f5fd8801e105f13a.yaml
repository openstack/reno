    The default sort order for branch names has been modified in order
    to accomodate the way OpenStack stable branches are named. Branches
    that match the pattern ``stable/[0-9].*`` will be sorted as
    ``stable/zzz[0-9].*``. This ensures that the new numerical branch
    names like ``stable/2023.1`` will be sorted after the older stable
    branches like ``stable/zed``. Two new variables have been added to
    control the behaviour, ``branch_sort_re`` and ``branch_sort_prefix``.
    See their help text for more information.
